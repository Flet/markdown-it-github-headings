## 2.0.0 2020-01-14

  - BREAKING: add resetSlugger option and default to true
    - This change avoids needlessly incrementing the duplicate slug counter between .render() calls. It is now the default behavior.
    - set the option `resetSlugger` to `false` to switch back to the old behavior if desired.
